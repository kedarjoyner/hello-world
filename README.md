# Hello World

I'm a graphic design student looking to enhance my skills by learning code. I was inspired to learn recently by a talk Jessica Hische gave in 2012 on the importance of art and tech. After browsing the web on where to get started, I brewed an entire pot of coffee. 

I think I'm going to need more.
